Added a sudoku solver that I whipped up
I am not sure if the solver can complete any solvable sudoku though
I have seen recursive solvers that try all solutions
My programme emulates the way I solve sudokus by looking for places
that there is only one possible number to go there.
This is only by scanning the corresponding rows, columns and
3x3 boxes of the selected empty place
